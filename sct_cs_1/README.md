4. View the result in the output field
5. Use the "Copy" button to copy the result to your clipboard

## About Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest and simplest forms of encryption. It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of 3:
- A would be replaced by D
- B would become E
- C would become F
- And so on...

This tool allows you to experiment with different shift values and see how the encryption works visually through the interactive cipher wheel.

## Technologies Used
